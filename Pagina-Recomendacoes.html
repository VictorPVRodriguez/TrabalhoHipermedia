                    <h4>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
                        in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h4>
                    <p>“I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
                        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
                        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                        the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.”

                    <p>“I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer 
                        for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself.”

                    <h4>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h4>
                    <p>“Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
                        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
                        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
                        could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
                        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
                        100% recommend!”</p>

                        learning from their experiences was easy.</h4>    
                    <p>“The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
                        gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
                        junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
                        an incredible community of smart and amazing people.”
